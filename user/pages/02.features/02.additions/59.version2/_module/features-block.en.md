Armada brings to the Jaxon library an ease of use and features inspired by PHP frameworks.

When using Armada, the Jaxon application bootstraps from a single configuration file, and its classes inherit automatically from a rich set of functionalities.
Armada is also coupled with Sentry, which provides a common API across all the frameworks integration packages.
