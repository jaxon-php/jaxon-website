The [uploaded files](../../../../03.docs/03.v4x/05.features/06.upload/) can now be saved to various storage systems, thanks to the [Flysystem package](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com).

The upload feature is also moved to the [jaxon-upload](https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-upload) package, and disabled by default.
