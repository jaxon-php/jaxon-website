Each function provided by the `Response` class to set the content or the layout of a webpage performs an action on a single element, identified by its `id` attribute.

The jQuery PHP API allows to use the same selectors as the jQuery javascript library, and therefore can apply a fonction simultaneously to multiple elements in a webpage, selected using various criteria.
