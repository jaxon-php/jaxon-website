[Jaxon DbAdmin](https://github.com/lagdo/jaxon-dbadmin/?target=_blank) is a database management tool that is inserted in a page of an existing PHP application, instead of being installed like [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/?target=_blank) or [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/?target=_blank).
