Plugins extend the web page content definition features of Jaxon, by allowing different or more complex operations than those provided by the library.
They can use a third party javascript library for this purpose.

Jaxon includes a [jQuery plugin](../../docs/v3x/responses/jquery.html), and there is a [Dialogs plugin](https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-dialogs) which displays windows and messages.

[Read the documentation](../../docs/v3x/plugins/response.html)
