Plugins extend the Jaxon core library features, by implementing different or more complex operations.
They can use a third party Javascript library for this purpose.

For example, plugins are provided for [file upload](../../docs/v5x/features/upload.html), [dialogs](../../docs/v5x/ui-features/dialogs.html) and [chart creation](https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-flot).
