These extensions make it easy to use Jaxon with PHP frameworks and CMS.
They allow Jaxon to integrate the framework features for configuration, views, and even dependency injection.

Integration plugins exist for many frameworks, including [Laravel](https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-laravel), [Symfony](https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-symfony), and [Slim Framework](https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-slim).
