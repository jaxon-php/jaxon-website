A Jaxon response is an object that encapsulates the commands to be executed in the browser in response to a Jaxon request.
All functions called by Jaxon should therefore return an object of type `Jaxon\Response\Response`.

By default there is a response in the library Jaxon which is returned by the `Jaxon::getResponse()` call.
However, it is possible to create others, by instantiating the `Jaxon\Response\Response` class.

```php
use Jaxon\Response\Response;

class MyClass
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->response = new Response;
    }

    public function firstMethod()
    {
        // Function body
        return $this->response;
    }

    public function secondMethod()
    {
        // Function body
        return $this->response;
    }
}
```

By calling successively several functions that access the same instance of `Jaxon\Response\Response`, a complex series of actions to be executed in the browser can be constructed in a simple way.

```php
use Jaxon\Response\Response;

class MyClass
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->response = new Response;
    }

    public function firstMethod()
    {
        // Function body
        return $this->response;
    }

    public function secondMethod()
    {
        // Function body
        $this->firstMethod();
        return $this->response;
    }

    public function thirdMethod()
    {
        // Function body
        $this->firstMethod();
        $this->secondMethod();
        return $this->response;
    }
}
```
