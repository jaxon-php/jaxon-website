The `jaxon-armada` and `jaxon-sentry` packages are removed, and their features are integrated in the `jaxon-core` package.

Thereby, the library by default provides views and session management features, integration with PHP frameworks, and a base class which can be used to enrich exported classes with some very useful features.
