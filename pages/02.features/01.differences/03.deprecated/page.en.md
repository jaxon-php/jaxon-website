##### Dropped XML format

The Jaxon library now only supports JSON. The support of XML is abandoned, and the configuration options `responseType` and `contentType` that allowed to choose the encoding are deprecated.

##### Abandoned classes

The classes below have not been reported from the Xajax library to Jaxon either because the features they provide are no longer relevant, or because they had not yet been fully implemented.

* xajaxCustomRequest
* xajaxCustomResponse
* xajaxControl
* xajaxControlContainer
* xajaxScriptPlugin
* xajaxIncludeClientScriptPlugin
