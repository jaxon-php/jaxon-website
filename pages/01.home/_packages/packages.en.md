Packages are a unique and original feature of Jaxon.
They are full featured web applications but instead of being installed on a server, they are inserted into an existing PHP application.

The [Jaxon Adminer](https://github.com/lagdo/jaxon-adminer) db manager and the [Supervisor dashboard](https://github.com/lagdo/jaxon-supervisor) are two examples of Jaxon packages.
