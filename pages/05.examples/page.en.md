All examples presented here are variants of the Xajax [Hello World](https://github.com/Xajax/Xajax/blob/master/examples/helloworld.php?target=_blank) example.

The simple examples show the features inherited from Xajax, that is how to export a function or a class, how to generate and call the corresponding javascript code, and how to use a plugin.

The advanced examples show the features that were added in Jaxon, that is how to read the configuration from a file, how to register all classes in a directory, and how to use namespaces and autoloading in the classes of a Jaxon Application.

The integration examples show how to use Jaxon with the most common PHP frameworks.
